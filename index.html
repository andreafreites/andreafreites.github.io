    Her research examines how emerging powers—particularly China—interact with state institutions in 
    developing economies, with a focus on environmental governance, extractive industries, and regulatory 
    compliance in Latin America. Substantively, her work speaks to debates in Global Political Economy, 
    International Relations and Comparative Environmental Politics. Methodologically, she employs 
    quantitative and mixed-methods approaches.
